Qiang He (何强)

I'm currently a second-year master student at [Insititute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.ia.cas.cn/) (CASIA), advised by [Prof Xinwen Hou](http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~xwhou). Before coming to Institute of Automation, I received my B.E. in Electric Engineering from [China University of Geosciences, Beijing](https://www.cugb.edu.cn/) in 2019. Currently, I am looking forward a PhD position. 

I'm interested in reinforcement learning, machine learning, and information estimation. Specifically, I'd like to build intelligent agent, which make decision with information coming from different sources. Recently I focus on offline RL.
