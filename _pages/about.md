# Bio

I'm currently an fisrt-year PhD student at [University of Tuebingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/). Before coming to University of Tuebingen, I received my Master's degree in Pattern Recoginition and Intelligent System from [Insititute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.ia.cas.cn/). 

I'm interested in reinforcement learning, machine learning. Specifically, my research idea is to propose or improve reinforcement learning algorithms inspired by theoretical insights. Currently, I am interested in the combination between optimization theory and RL.




[comment]:<Research Experience>

[comment]:<I'm broadly interested in the problem of creating agent to achieve human level intelligence. I've been thinking about data, information, manifolds for a long time. >

[comment]:<For the summer of 2018, I was an intern at the [National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/en/) where I worked with Professor [Junliang Xing](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jSwNd3MAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Peixi Peng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=CFMuFGoAAAAJ)  on the multi agent reinforcement learning communication. >

[comment]:<For the autumn of 2018, I get the M.S. offer from Institute of Automation without examination. I work with Professor Xinwen Hou on the reinforcement learning. >

# Miscellaneous

I'm very interested in science fiction. I am a big fan of [*Remembrance of Earth's Past* (三体, 地球往事三部曲)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_of_Earth%27s_Past). I have read almost all the early Chinese science fiction. Besides, I am also a lover of literature. I like magical realism novels and realism novels. I like watching suspense movies. My dear friend gave me a harmonica and I am trying to practice it.
