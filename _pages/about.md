# Bio

I'm currently a second-year master student at [Insititute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.ia.cas.cn/), advised by [Prof. Xinwen Hou](http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~xwhou). Before coming to Institute of Automation, I received my B.E. in Electric Engineering from [China University of Geosciences, Beijing](https://www.cugb.edu.cn/) in 2019. <font color='red'>Currently, I am looking for a PhD position. Please feel free to shoot me an email! </font> 

I'm interested in reinforcement learning, machine learning. Specifically, I'd like to build intelligent agent, which make decision with information coming from different sources. Recently I focus on offline RL.

# Research Experience

I'm broadly interested in the problem of creating agent to achieve human level intelligence. I've been thinking about data, information, manifolds for a long time. 

For the summer of 2018, I was an intern at the [National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/en/) where I worked with Professor [Junliang Xing](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jSwNd3MAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Peixi Peng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=CFMuFGoAAAAJ)  on the multi agent reinforcement learning communication. 

For the autumn of 2018, I get the M.S. offer from Institute of Automation without examination. I work with Professor Xinwen Hou on the reinforcement learning.

# Miscellaneous

I'm very interested in science fiction. I am a big fan of [*Remembrance of Earth's Past* (三体, 地球往事三部曲)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_of_Earth%27s_Past). I have read almost all the early Chinese science fiction. Besides, I am also a lover of literature. I like magical realism novels and realism novels. I like watching suspense movies.
